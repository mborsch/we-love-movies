This is a project completed for Thinkful's Software Engineer Bootcamp.

This project tested the ability to build complex servers and access data through a database. API built following RESTful principles, customized knexfile.js, created 
a connection to data with Knex, wrote database queries to complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes in an Express server, return joined and nested data
with Knex, wrote database migrations using Knex's migration tool, and deployed my backend server using Heroku.
